Introduction
======================

The goal of this assignment is to further familiarizing with programming with images. The program takes an image of a face as an input, manipulates it in two different ways and then outputs the processed faces. Tasks are as followed:
1. Create a grayscale image of your face by converting your color image using one of the conversions we discussed in class last week.
2. Come up with another way of manipulating your face that produces an interesting output. For example, you may create a blurred image of your grayscale face by assigning to each pixel the average grayscale pixel value of itself and its 8 neighbors. Hint: You may have to run your program a few times to make the blurring noticeable.This assigment consists of 2 different part. For the first part of the assignment we were supposed to convert a colored image to gray scale.

Task 1
---------------------
For this task, we were supposed to change a color scaled image to grayscale. There are multiple ways for doing this, I weighted color channels according to the formula:

Y_linear = (0.2126 * R_linear) + (0.7152 * G_linear) + (0.0722 * B_linear)[1][Michael Stokes, Matthew Anderson, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, and Ricardo Motta, "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet â€“ sRGB", [online](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB) see matrix at end of Part 2.]

While converting a color scaled image to gray scaled image, this formulation takes channel-dependent luminance perception into account. Which based on the idea that green looks about ten times brighter than blue to human eyes. This formulation provided us by psychologists who carefully designed experiments in order to figure out how different we perceive the luminance or red, green, and blue to be. For more information about this you can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Colorimetric_(perceptual_luminance-preserving)_conversion_to_grayscale)

Task 2
--------
For this task we were supposed to manipulate our image with some other creative way. I made color quantization for this part of the assignemnt. By using K-Means algorithm with different K values, I clustered pixels what are near each other in terms of their pixel values. Below images are the results for K value equals to 2, 4, 16, 64 respectively. As we may expect, the image converges to the original image as K value increases.
