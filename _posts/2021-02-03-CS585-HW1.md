Introduction
======================

The goal of this assignment is to further familiarizing with programming with images. The program takes an image of a face as an input, manipulates it in two different ways and then outputs the processed faces. Tasks are as followed:

1. Create a grayscale image of your face by converting your color image using one of the conversions we discussed in class last week.

2. Come up with another way of manipulating your face that produces an interesting output. 

Task 1 : Converting The Image To Grayscale
---------------------
For this task, we were supposed to change a color scaled image to grayscale. There are multiple ways for doing this, I weighted color channels according to the formula:

> **Y_linear = (0.2126 * R_linear) + (0.7152 * G_linear) + (0.0722 * B_linear)** [1]

> [1][Michael Stokes, Matthew Anderson, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, and Ricardo Motta, "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet â€“ sRGB", [online](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB) see matrix at end of Part 2.]

While converting a color scaled image to gray scaled image, this formulation takes channel-dependent luminance perception into account. Which based on the idea that green looks about ten times brighter than blue to human eyes. This formulation provided us by psychologists who carefully designed experiments in order to figure out how different we perceive the luminance or red, green, and blue to be. For more information about this you can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Colorimetric_(perceptual_luminance-preserving)_conversion_to_grayscale).

Task 2 : Color Quantization
--------
For this task we were supposed to manipulate our image with some other creative way. I made color quantization for this part of the assignment. *Color quantization*  is quantization applied to color spaces; it is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_quantization) 

By using K-Means algorithm with different K values, I clustered pixels that are near each other in terms of their pixel values. For this purpose, I first pick K number of cluster centers randomly. Then iteratively computed cluster centers and reassigned pixel values for 10 times. In other words, assigned each pixel to the pixel value of closest cluster center then computed and updated pixel values of cluster centers by taking the mean of pixel values in each cluster. Below images are the results for K value equals to 2, 4, 16, 64 respectively. As we may expected, the image converges to the original image as K value increases.
