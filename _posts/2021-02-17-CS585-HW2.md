Problem Definition
---------------------

The aim of this project was designing and implementing algorithms that recognize hand shapes (such as making thumbs up, thumbs down, peace etc.) and creating a graphical display that responds to the recognition of the hand shapes. Recognizing hand shapes is an important problem, an extended version of this project can be used for sign languge detection. Since we used skin color detection inside the project, we are making the assumption that the background color is not similar to human skin color. We are also assuming that the environment is properly lighted. 

Method and Implementation
---------------------

We used template matching, background differencing and skin color detection in our code. First of all we take the first frame when the web cam is opened as F_0 and set it as background. After that we subtracted each new frame from this background image and we detected skin color in this differenced frame. After that we used OpenCV build in template matching algorithm to match the web cam image with out templates.   

Experiments
---------------------

Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you performed, and the relevant parameter values.

Define your evaluation metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time.

Since it was a real time system, it was a little bit hard to do experiments and decide the evaluation metrics (for example, in order to take the hand sign as detected how many frames we can tolearte?)

We used below images as our templates:
![Original Image](/pics/hand.jpg "Hand Template"){:height="120px" width="80px"}
![Original Image](/pics/peace.jpg "Peace Template"){:height="120px" width="80px"}
![Original Image](/pics/thumbs_up.jpg "Thumbs_up Template"){:height="120px" width="80px"}
![Original Image](/pics/thumbs_down.jpg "Thumbs_down Template"){:height="120px" width="80px"}

Results

Discussion
---------------------

Out method was generally successful but it was not very robust, it was getting effected from illumination conditions. It performed well in general as expected. 

As a potential future work we could use normalized correlation coefficient function instead of taking absolute differences. By this was it can be more robust to the changes of the illumination. If we would have more time, it would be nice to try some image moments (such as circularity) to detect different hand shapes. By this way our algorithm could not detect the head even if it would be show up in the camera. 


Conclusions
---------------------

In this project, we build a computer vision system which can detect some basic hand shapes by looking at the skin color and template matching. However skin color detection by pixel values is not a robust system it should be supperted with some additional algorithms like finding circularity of the image of interest.
