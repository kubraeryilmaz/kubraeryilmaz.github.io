Problem Definition
---------------------

Give a concise description of current problem. What needs to be solved? Why is the result useful? Do you make any assumptions? What are the anticipated difficulties?


Method and Implementation
---------------------

Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or the mathematical formulation of your method.

Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the algorithmic steps you described earlier.

Experiments
---------------------

Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you performed, and the relevant parameter values.

Define your evaluation metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time.

Results
---------------------

List your experimental results. Provide examples of input images and output images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps. 
If your work involves videos, you can add links here, but also make sure to follow the specific homework instructions on how to submit videos.

Discussion
---------------------

Discuss your method and results:

What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method?
Do your results show that your method is generally successful or are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your results.
Potential future work. How could your method be improved? What would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the failures/limitations of your work?

Conclusions
---------------------
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions? What is your main message?

Credits and Bibliography
---------------------

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing your solution. Citations to papers should include the authors, the year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and institution).

Material on the web should include the url and date of access.

Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
