Introduction
---------------------

The goal of this assignment is learning more about the practical issues that arise when designing a tracking system. We are asked to track moving objects in video sequences, i.e., identifying the same object from frame to frame. General outline for our approach:

1. We considered two frames at a time instead of using multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) with more than two frames.

2. We used a greedy, suboptimal bipartite matching algorithm with some improvements.

3. To estimate the state of each tracked object, we used an alpha-beta filter.

For this assignment we were expected to use 2 different videos one shows a flying bat swarm and the other shows cells in a Petri dish. We were provided the bats loactions but we implemented the segemntation for the cells.
