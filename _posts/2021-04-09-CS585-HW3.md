Introduction
---------------------

The goal of this assignment is learning more about the practical issues that arise when designing a tracking system. We are asked to track moving objects in video sequences, i.e., identifying the same object from frame to frame. General outline for our approach:

1. We considered two frames at a time instead of using multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) with more than two frames.

2. We used a greedy, suboptimal bipartite matching algorithm with some improvements.

3. To estimate the state of each tracked object, we used an alpha-beta filter.

For this assignment we were expected to use 2 different videos one shows a flying bat swarm and the other shows cells in a Petri dish.

Methodology
---------------------

We were provided the bats locations but we implemented the segmentation for the cells. For the segmantation, first we construct a manual circle to mask out the outside of the petri dish. Next, we blur the image with 5x5 kernel. Then we dilate with a rectangular kernel, find contours using the opencv countour detector, and we use openCV functionality to draw bounding boxes around the detected contours. Finally we identify the centers for localizations.

Our tracking algorithm is as follows:

1. Construct a euclidean distance matrix between localizations in a frame and predicted state for each track.

2. Use a bi-partite matching algorithm implementation in scipy (scipy.linear_sum_assingment) to do the matching

3. We additionally remove a single localization in the current frame, and recompute the optimal match. We repeat this for each localization. If the average cost per match decreases by more than a threshold, we consider this a new object.

4. Using these matches, update the state of each track using alpha-beta filtering.


Discussions
---------------------

In general our tracking method works well, except too challenging situations like occulusions. I answered the questions in the assignment by providing some supporting images below.

1 Tracking Results
---------------------

Here is an example for tracking results on Bats dataset. *

Here is an example for tracking results on Cells dataset.

Challenging situations that our tracker succeeds(green) and fails(red):

For the bats dataset, occulusion detection was a very challenging case that we fail to cover on the other hand, we succeeded on the bat doing the loop that can be a challenging task as well.


2 Begining to New Tracks and Terminating Old Tracks
---------------------
If an object leaves the field of view we terminate the track. We tried keeping old tracks around but this left us matching to old tracks of bats long gone. If we have a new object we get a new track. In the cost matrix if we get some costs that are above our treshold, we are assuming that they are new tracks.

3 Occlusion Detection
---------------------
Our current implementation can't handle the case when objects touch and occlude each other. If we had more time, we could do tracking across multiple time-scales and merge across time scales. The courses time scale would have occlusion be less likely. You could merge tracks by selecting the lower frame rate one if two timescales disagree. 

4 Spurious Detections 
---------------------
If there are spurious detections that do not connect with other measurements in subsequent frames, our algorithm can fail with a high-cost optimal bipartite matching. We try to account for this case with our 'cost threshold'. If not matching a localization decreases the cost by more than some threshold, we just start a new track. If this localization then fails to match in the next frame, it goes away. Nevertheless, our algorithm could be made more robust in this regard, potentially with variants of multiple hypothesis tracking. 

5 The Advantages and Drawbacks of Different Kinematic Models
---------------------
For the tracking task, the object motion that we are trying to track really metters so a carryfully designed kinematic model! For example, we found that with bats it is useful to model velocity because they geneally have a certain route and they are moving fast. However the cell motion is more random and modelling velocity mostly harms the model.

Conclusions
---------------------
Even though we used a very simple approach, our tracing algorithm works reasonably. For improvement we could try using Kalman Filter for prediction, we could consider using more then 2 frames at a time and we could try to improve data association algorithm.
