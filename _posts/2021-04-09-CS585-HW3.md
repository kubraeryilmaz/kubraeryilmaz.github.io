Introduction
---------------------

The goal of this assignment is learning more about the practical issues that arise when designing a tracking system. We are asked to track moving objects in video sequences, i.e., identifying the same object from frame to frame. General outline for our approach:

1. We considered two frames at a time instead of using multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) with more than two frames.

2. We used a greedy, suboptimal bipartite matching algorithm with some improvements.

3. To estimate the state of each tracked object, we used an alpha-beta filter.

For this assignment we were expected to use 2 different videos one shows a flying bat swarm and the other shows cells in a Petri dish. We were provided the bats loactions but we implemented the segemntation for the cells.

Discussions
---------------------
Show your tracking results on some portion of the sequence. In addition to showing your tracking results on an easy portion of the data, identify a challenging situation where your tracker succeeds, and a challenging situation where your tracker fails.
How do you decide to begin new tracks and terminate old tracks as the objects enter and leave the field of view?
What happens with your algorithm when objects touch and occlude each other, and how could you handle this so you do not break track?
What happens when there are spurious detections that do not connect with other measurements in subsequent frames?
What are the advantages and drawbacks of different kinematic models: Do you need to model the velocity of the objects, or is it sufficient to just consider the distances between the objects in subsequent frames?
